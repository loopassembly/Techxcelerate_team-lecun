A one stop digital and physical identity verification platform built on web3. It enables users to verify their eligibility or identity while sharing minimal to no personal information with verifying organizations.

 - Provides users with a single identity solution that could be used **across all platforms** from logging into websites to completing KYCs for banks.
 - Provides identity verification while sharing minimal to no personal information by applying the concept of **Zero Knowledge Proof**
 - Acts as **single unified identity** for multiple identification documents providing hassle free experience for users.
 - Makes the traditional identity verification process  **faster** by reducing the need for multi step repetitive verifications.
 - Features **Protobot**, our in-house AI assistant, capable of answering identity-related queries and app-specific questions. It supports responses in all Indian languages.
 
## Why ProtoID?
From creating an online account for a website to creating a bank account physically, proving your identity always involved sharing personal information. But not anymore! ProtoID lets you verify your identity on your terms. Share only what's needed and nothing more. 

## Use-Cases

**1. Hassle-Free Banking & KYC**
A freelancer from another country struggles to open a bank account due to excessive documentation requirements. ProtoID enables instant, secure verification without revealing unnecessary personal details.

**2. Preventing Online Fraud & Identity Theft**
A user’s identity is stolen and used for fraudulent loans. With ProtoID’s decentralized verification, only the real owner can authenticate transactions, preventing impersonation and fraud.

**3. Secure & Anonymous Voting**
In a national election, citizens want to vote online but fear data breaches and manipulation. ProtoID ensures voter authentication while maintaining privacy and preventing election fraud.

**4. Academic Credential Verification**
A job applicant’s degree certificate is questioned by an employer. Instead of slow, manual verification, ProtoID provides instant, tamper-proof proof of credentials on the blockchain.

 **5. Cross-Border Identity Verification**
A refugee without traditional identity documents struggles to access essential services. ProtoID allows secure verification using verifiable credentials linked to their past records, enabling them to rebuild their life.
