A one stop digital and physical identity verification platform built on web3. It enables users to verify their eligibility or identity while sharing minimal to no personal information with verifying organizations.

 - Provides users with a single identity solution that could be used **across all platforms** from logging into websites to completing KYCs for banks.
 - Provides identity verification while sharing minimal to no personal information by applying the concept of **Zero Knowledge Proof**
 - Acts as **single unified identity** for multiple identification documents providing hassle free experience for users.
 - Makes the traditional identity verification process  **faster** by reducing the need for multi step repetitive verifications.
 - Features **Protobot**, our in-house AI assistant, capable of answering identity-related queries and app-specific questions. It supports responses in all Indian languages.
 
## Why ProtoID?
From creating an online account for a website to creating a bank account physically, proving your identity always involved sharing personal information. But not anymore! ProtoID lets you verify your identity on your terms. Share only what's needed and nothing more. 

## Use Cases  

### 1. Hassle-Free Banking & KYC  
Imagine being a freelancer from another country, trying to open a bank account, only to be stuck in a maze of paperwork and endless verification steps. With ProtoID, you can instantly verify your identity securely—without oversharing personal details.  

### 2. Stopping Online Fraud & Identity Theft  
Picture this: someone steals your identity and takes out fraudulent loans in your name. ProtoID’s decentralized verification ensures only *you* can authenticate transactions, keeping impersonators and fraudsters out.  

### 3. Secure & Anonymous Online Voting  
Online voting could make elections more accessible, but concerns about data breaches and manipulation hold people back. ProtoID guarantees voter authentication while protecting privacy, ensuring a fair and tamper-proof election process.  

### 4. Instant Academic Credential Verification  
A job applicant submits their degree certificate, but the employer questions its authenticity. Instead of going through slow, manual verification, ProtoID provides an instant, tamper-proof record of their credentials on the blockchain.  

### 5. Cross-Border Identity Verification  
For refugees and displaced individuals without traditional identity documents, accessing basic services can be a challenge. ProtoID enables secure verification using verifiable credentials linked to past records—helping them rebuild their lives with dignity.
